## About
The new cipher implementation for my cryptograpghy classes. The aim of the assignment was to come up with an algorithm to encrypt sentences in English and then decrypt them.
The cipher is an asymmetric encoding algorithm (that uses two keys to encrypt the message, whereas only one is known for the user).
The text.txt file contains three lines:
 - Original message, two sentences to encode
 - Message encoded with the algorithm
 - Message decoded to the original form
